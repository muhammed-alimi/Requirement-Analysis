# Requirement-Analysis in Software Development.
## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) that involves identifying, documenting, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It is the process through which software developers and project managers gather information about what the system should do, how it should perform, and any constraints or conditions under which it must operate.

This stage acts as a foundation for all subsequent phases—design, development, testing, and deployment. Its success significantly influences the overall quality and effectiveness of the final product.
## Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC
### 1. Foundation for Design and Development
Requirement analysis forms the base for system design. A flawed analysis can lead to incorrect design and implementation.

### 2. Prevents Scope Creep
Clearly defined requirements help prevent uncontrolled changes and additions during development.

### 3. Improves Communication
Acts as a reference point for stakeholders and developers, ensuring alignment.

### 4. Cost and Time Efficiency
Detecting and fixing issues early in the requirement phase is far less expensive than doing so in later stages.

### 5. Ensures User Satisfaction
Helps build systems that meet real user needs, enhancing usability and acceptance.

### 6. Supports Testing and Validation
Requirements serve as a basis for creating test cases and validating the final system.
## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
### 1. Prevents Costly Errors and Rework
Description: Identifying requirements early helps catch potential misunderstandings, missing functionality, or unrealistic expectations before development begins.

Impact: Fixing a defect in the requirement phase is significantly cheaper and faster than correcting it during coding or after deployment. Studies show that errors found in later stages can cost 10 to 100 times more to fix.
### 2. Ensures Alignment with Business Goals
Description: Requirement analysis helps translate business needs into technical solutions, ensuring that the software aligns with the organization's strategic objectives.

Impact: Projects that are aligned with business goals are more likely to deliver real value, gain stakeholder buy-in, and succeed in the long term.

### 3. Facilitates Better Project Planning and Estimation
Description: Well-defined requirements allow for more accurate estimation of time, resources, and cost.

Impact: With clear scope and objectives, project managers can create realistic timelines, allocate appropriate resources, and set achievable milestones, reducing the risk of delays and budget overruns.
## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
### 1. Requirement Gathering
Requirement Gathering is the initial step where raw information about the expected functionalities and constraints of the system is collected from stakeholders such as clients, users, and subject matter experts.
### 2. Requirement Elicitation
Elicitation is a deeper and more structured process that focuses on drawing out accurate, complete, and detailed requirements from stakeholders. It goes beyond just collecting data—it involves critical thinking, questioning, and clarification.
### 3. Requirement Documentation
This activity involves formally writing down all the elicited and clarified requirements in an organized and standard format, usually in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
### 4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling
This step involves examining the documented requirements to identify inconsistencies, redundancies, ambiguities, and feasibility concerns. It often includes modeling the system behavior, data flow, and structure.
### 5. Requirement Validation
Validation ensures that the requirements accurately reflect the stakeholder needs and are feasible, clear, complete, and testable.
## Types of Requirements.
### ✅ Functional Requirements.
Functional requirements: specify what the system should do — the specific behaviors, services, and functions it must support.
### 1. Hotel Management Service
Hotel Registration: Allow hotel managers to register their hotels on the platform.

Manage Hotel Information: Enable managers to add, update, or delete hotel details, including room types, availability, pricing, and amenities.

Inventory Management: Provide tools for managers to manage room inventories and set prices on a daily basis.
### 2. Customer Service (Search + Booking)
Search Functionality: Allow customers to search for hotels based on location, check-in/check-out dates, and other filters.

View Hotel Details: Enable customers to view detailed information about hotels, including room types, prices, and amenities.

Booking Process: Allow customers to select rooms and proceed with bookings, integrating with payment services for transaction processing.

Booking Confirmation: Send confirmation notifications to customers upon successful booking
### 3. View Booking Service
Booking History: Allow both customers and hotel managers to view current and past bookings.

Booking Management: Enable users to modify or cancel bookings as per the hotel's policies.
### ✅ Non-Functional Requirements.
Non-functional requirements define how the system performs — the quality attributes, constraints, and standards the system must meet.
### 1. Scalability
The system should handle a high volume of user traffic and data, scaling horizontally to accommodate growth.
### 2. Performance
Low Latency: Ensure quick response times for search queries and booking processes.

High Throughput: Support a large number of concurrent users performing searches and bookings simultaneously
### 3. Availability
Implement a highly available architecture to minimize downtime and ensure continuous service.
## Use Case Diagrams.
### ✅ Use Case Diagrams Defination:
Use Case Diagrams are a type of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram used to visually represent the interactions between users (actors) and a system. They outline the functional requirements of a system by depicting what the system does (use cases), who interacts with it (actors), and how they interact at a high level.
### ✅ Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:
#### 1. Clarifies System Scope

Helps define what the system will and will not do, avoiding scope creep.
#### 2. Enhances Communication

Provides a clear and simple visual representation that both technical and non-technical stakeholders can understand.
#### 3. Improves Requirement Understanding

Helps gather, validate, and refine functional requirements early in the development process.
#### 4. Supports Design and Testing

Acts as a blueprint for designing user interaction flows and helps QA teams derive test cases from user scenarios.
#### 5. Facilitates User-Centered Design

Keeps the focus on how users will interact with the system, improving usability.
